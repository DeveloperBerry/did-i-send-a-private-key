# Did I send a private key???

Tool to use when you're not sure if you've leaked an ethereum-based private key or mnemonic.

*Might violate discord TOS...*

I made this **very** quickly, so it may be a bit messy :'( 

Install:

```
npm install

or

yarn install
```

Create `.env` file in root directory.

Populate with:

```
DISCORD_TOKEN=discord.token.here
```

Run:

```
npm run start

or

yarn start
```
